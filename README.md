Renamefiles
===========

Rename a file in specific format.

I had more than 100K files with weird extension. Example - "data-script.sql.001" but in sequence.
So next file was "data-script.sql.002" and so on.

Desired format - "data-script-001.sql", "data-script-002.sql" and so on...

This program helps to rename the file in that specific format.

Inputs to provide:

Source path, Destination path, desired extension.
