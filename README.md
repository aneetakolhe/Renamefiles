Renamefiles
===========

Rename a file in specific format.

I had more than 100K files with weird extension. Example - "data-script.sql.001" but in sequence.
So next file was "data-script.sql.002" and so on.

Desired format - "data-script-001.sql", "data-script-002.sql" and so on...

This program helps to rename the file in that specific format.

All files are in the same folder.

Changes to be made according to user's Source path, Destination path and desired extension.
Source path, Destination path, desired extension.
